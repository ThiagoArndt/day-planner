This is my first react app. I used React, NextJS and MongoDB to make it.  
Also, the design was taken from here:

# How to start the application

- First, you need to run 'npm install' on your terminal;
- After all dependencies are installed, go to the "settings.js" file;
- There you can configure your MongoDB server.
- Then you can run 'npm run dev' on your terminal to start the server.
